# Assignments 7 and 8

Assignments 7 and 8 will focus on forms in HTML and CSS.

In this repository you will find a mockup file showing a simple sign up form. The first part (assignment #7) of the assignment is to create the necessary HTML, and the second part (assignment #8) is to style the form using CSS. Everything in the mockup should be included in your submission, including the background.

Do your best to match the mockup, but bear in mind that I would prefer to see good practices and technique rather than pixel perfection. The goal is not perfection, it is to demonstrate that you understand forms and how to build and style them, and to demonstrate that you can write strong, semantic and accurate code.

## Assignment #7 - Forms in HMTL

Your goal in assignment #7 will be to create the HTML for the form. Bear in mind that at this point in the semester, you should be fully capable of writing high quality, semantic HTML.

To get the best grade possible:

- Ensure that your HTML is well structured (no unnecessary elements, use the correct HTML elements, etc)
- Check MDN to ensure that you are using form and HTML elements correctly!
- Your HTML should include **ALL** elements from the mockup, including text, buttons and the background container
- The form does not need to be functional at all - only HTML and CSS is required, no JavaScript should be added

## Assignment #8 - Styling forms with CSS

Your goal for assignment #8 will be to style the form using CSS.

To get the best grade possible:

- Use the methods and approaches shown in class
- You can find icons online, preferably using [Tailwind icons](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/icons) - the icons do not need to match the mockup exactly, but they should be close.
- Try to match the colours as closely as possible (use the eyedropper in MS Paint to quickly get the correct colour from the mockup)
- Remember that everything we've learned about layout and styling is applicable inside forms
